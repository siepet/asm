                        Which consists of all my work during the classes.
                        At this time, it has only printing numbers in 
                        binary, octal, hexadecimal and decimal to stdout.
                        
                        
                        bin1.asm  prints ax in binary form 
                        oct1.asm  prints ax in octal form
			hex1.asm  prints ax in hex form
			deci.asm  prints ax in decimal form
			napis.asm prints a string (puts in C)
                      	debe.asm  prints a number in hex, defined in DB 
                      	

                        asm is fun
